This Selenium script automates testing a login flow with valid and invalid credentials. AI significantly improves test coverage compared to manual testing. While a human tester might run a few key scenarios, an AI-powered automation framework can execute hundreds of test variations in the time it takes to manually test oneâ€”including edge cases with different browsers, screen sizes, and input combinations.

Tools like Testim.io use AI to self-heal locators; if a button's ID changes, the AI can often still find it, reducing test maintenance overhead. This resilience is a game-changer. Furthermore, AI can analyze the application to suggest critical test paths a human might miss, leading to more robust test suites. This automation frees up QA engineers from repetitive checks to focus on more complex, exploratory testing, ultimately enhancing software quality and accelerating release cycles.
