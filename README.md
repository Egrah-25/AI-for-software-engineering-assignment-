AI for Software Engineering Assignment
A comprehensive assignment demonstrating AI applications in software engineering, featuring code completion analysis, automated testing, and predictive modeling.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project explores three key areas where AI enhances software engineering:
1. **AI-Powered Code Completion** with GitHub Copilot
2. **Automated Testing** with Selenium
3. **Predictive Analytics** for resource allocation using machine learning



## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub Copilot (for Task 1)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository

# Install dependencies
pip install -r task3_predictive_analytics/requirements.txt
```

📊 Task Details

Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

· File: task1_code_completion/
· Description: Comparison between GitHub Copilot suggestions and manual implementation for sorting algorithms
· Key Findings: AI-generated code was more efficient and Pythonic

Task 2: Automated Testing with AI

· File: task2_automated_testing/
· Description: Selenium-based automated testing for login functionality
· Features: Valid/invalid credential testing with success/failure reporting

Task 3: Predictive Analytics

· File: task3_predictive_analytics/
· Description: Random Forest classifier for issue priority prediction
· Performance: 97.66% accuracy, 95.83% F1-score for high-priority class

📈 Results Summary

Task Key Metric Result
Task 1 Code Efficiency AI version: O(n log n) vs Manual: O(n²)
Task 2 Test Automation 100% success rate on login tests
Task 3 Model Accuracy 97.66% overall accuracy

🧠 Ethical Considerations

The project includes analysis of potential biases in predictive models and discusses mitigation strategies using fairness tools like IBM AIF360.
